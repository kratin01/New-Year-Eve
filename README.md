# New-Year-Eve
this project creates a visually appealing countdown timer for New Year's Eve, displaying the time remaining in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The countdown is updated every second using JavaScript's setInterval function. It's a simple and fun project that demonstrates HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript skills.
